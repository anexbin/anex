# Milestones

**Purpose:** Track all development goals for the game, divided by timeframe.

## Why this folder exists
- Keeps your project goal-oriented and manageable.
- Helps break the game into short-term, mid-term, and long-term objectives.
- Allows you to track progress and adjust plans if something takes longer.

## Suggested structure
- short_term.md → 1–3 month goals.
- mid_term.md → 6–12 month goals.
- long_term.md → 1–5 year goals.

## Notes
- Use checklists to mark completed milestones.
- Write lessons learned and challenges to reference later.
