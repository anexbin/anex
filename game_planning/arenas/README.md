# Arenas

**Purpose:** Plan each arena’s mechanics, design, and skill progression.

## Why this folder exists
- Each arena is a game stage with unique challenges and cards.
- Helps design, balance, and track skills per arena.
- Acts as a reference for coding, reducing trial-and-error later.

## Suggested files
- arena1.md … arena8.md

## Notes
- Include sketches or mockups if needed.
- Track skills learned per arena (collision detection, AI, card interactions).
